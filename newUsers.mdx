- **Code Editor**: [Download VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Cursor](https://www.cursor.so/)
- **GitHub Account**: Sign up at [github.com](https://github.com). Use a name-based username (e.g. `davidaviles`)
- **Git**: Helps manage files. Install it by running this in Terminal:

  npm install git
  ```

- **Terminal**: A built-in app on every computer. (Code editors like VSCode also include a terminal.)

## ðŸš€ First Time Setup

### 1. Install Mintlify CLI

```bash
npm i mintlify -g
```

> If already installed, update it with:
```bash
npm i mintlify@latest -g
```

### 2. Get Access to Mintlify GitHub

- Create your GitHub account.
- Ask **Han** or **Hanbee** to add you to the Mintlify GitHub organization.

### 3. Clone the Docs Repo

In Terminal:

```bash
cd Documents
git clone https://github.com/mintlify/docs.git
cd docs
mintlify dev
```

This will:

## ðŸ›  Making Updates

### 1. Check if You Already Have the Docs Repo

```bash
cd Documents
cd docs
git status
```

If your files arenâ€™t up to date, run:

```bash
git pull
```

### 2. Create a Branch to Make Changes

```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

> Youâ€™ll make changes on this branch without affecting the main docs.

### 3. Start the Live Preview

```bash
mintlify dev
```

A browser window will open so you can see your changes live.
